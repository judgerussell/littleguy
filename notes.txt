DIGITAL PET WHO TAKES CARE OF YOU

story ideas:
woman quarantined during right now finds old tamagotchi in drawer and takes it out. she sets the time and date, and plays with it for a little bit when it begins to speak. she's amazed while the thing explains that all tamagotchis can speak after a while ("you couldn't speak at 1 could you?") but most times the batteries run out first.
 
the gameplay is tamagotchi gameplay, but while it goes on the two have conversations and you take the role of the little thing
